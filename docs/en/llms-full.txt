### How to Check SQL Executed from GoldenGate (Integrated Replicat)

tags: Oracle, GoldenGate

In GoldenGate, SQL is internally executed and the information is stored in the Oracle Database shared pool.
Therefore, you can run the following SQL on the target side where the Replicat operates to check what SQL statements are being executed.
SELECT sql_id, plan_hash_value, sql_text, module, fetches, command_type, executions, first_load_time, last_active_time, action, service, is_bind_aware FROM V$SQL WHERE module=&#39;GoldenGate&#39;; Notes The sql_text column of (g)v$sql is VARCHAR2(1000), so for very long statements, use SQL_FULLTEXT of CLOB type and convert with dbms_lob.substr. To check bind variable values, query v$sql_bind_capture.
